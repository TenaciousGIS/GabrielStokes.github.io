                    Hello everyone! As of today, I am 19 year old working to become a productive member of society. I'm always trying to learn new things and take
                    on new challenges. If there's one thing you can always depend on me to for, it's my ability to find information. I tend to work really well on my own,
                    but when it comes to group work, I what they call "The Human Search Engine". I have really good memory and one of my biggest strenthgs lie in quick math.

                    My favorite thing in the world in all seriousness is music. I grew up in a very musically gifted family and I'm grateful. I have 9 years of piano
                    experience, I excell in transcribing music, writting music, and music theory in general. For the past year, I've been growing as a digital artist
                    and animator and as of 4 months ago, I started taking school for computer sience.
