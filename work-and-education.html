            <p class="colorBoxR">
                Starting out simple, I'm a highschool graduate who got into OTC for free thanks to my education. I'd partaken in several charity events, volunteer jobs, and
                and involved my self in state level band events during secondary school. From 17 to 18 years of age, I worked with my faimily in their construction business and
                have been working full time at Fedex since October.

            <p class="colorBoxL">
                I have had so many ambitions, and every day my epectations raise. The reason I took a computer science class was to gain a versatile skill set in the
                work force. Not only does it tie in to my other skills, it seems that is is also in high demand as of lately.
